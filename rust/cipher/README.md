Small set of utilities to break simple ciphers.

1. Vigenere Cipher
2. Caesar Cipher
3. Columnar Transposition Cipher

### TODO

**Vigenere**
    - [ ] Add a `encrypt_multi` and `decrypt_multi` functions that accepts a list of `usize`
    - [ ] Improve the key suggestion by factorizing the distances and then finding the most common factors
    - [ ] Improve public API
