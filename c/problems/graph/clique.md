# Clique

To know what is a **clique** is, first we need to know what is a **complete graph** also known as **k-n** graph,
where **n** is the number os vertices.

## Complete graph

A complete graph (k-n) is a graph where there are edges between all vertices of the graph. Let's see an example of a k-4 graph:

## So, what's a clique?

A clique of size n is basically a complete graph (k-n) that is a **subgraph** of a given graph.
