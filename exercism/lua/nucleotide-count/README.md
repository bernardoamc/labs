# Nucleotide Count

Write a class `DNA` that takes a DNA string and tells us how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

### Getting started
First install lua using [homebrew][1]

    $ brew install lua

Then install [luarocks][2] to install packages for lua

    $ brew install luarocks

Then install [busted][3] testing framework for lua

    $ luarocks install busted
    
Then run your test

    $ busted bob_test.lua
