The accuracy of nanosleep() is limited by the software clock, so if we don't
specify an interval that is multiple of the software clock the interval is
rounded up. If our program receive lot's of signals, each restart of nanosleep
can bring rounding into the game, so each interval will sleep longer than it
really should, thus causing the program to run longer than specified. We can
avoid this using clock_nanosleep() call with the flag TIMER_ABSTIME.
