a) This happens because the permissions are verified in the following order:
   owner, group and other. So, if you don't have the necessary owner permissions
   as an owner, that's it, the group permissions will not be verified.

b) Write + Execute permissions permit file creating on directiories
   Read permissions allow file listing
   Execute permit file search ands file access (by name only).

c) CREATE A NEW FILE:       execute + write permissions in directory
   OPEN A FILE FOR READING: execute on directory and read on file
   OPEN A FILE FOR WRITING: execute on directory and write on file
   DELETE A FILE:           write on directory only

   RENAME A FILE:
    - to the same directory:
        execute and write on directory only

    - to a different directory:
        execute and write on directory and read on file

    - if the target already exists:
        you need to have the permissions above to the target directory and file also

    - if the sticky flag is on:
        only the owner of the file or directory can rename it, or the super-user
