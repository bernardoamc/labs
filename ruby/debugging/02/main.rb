# Our developers have decided that use a class to format our information, but
# they got something wrong. Can you help them fix it?

# Challenges:
#   1. Fix the problem
#   2. Can you explain why this happens?

# Navigate the code with 'next', 'step' or 'continue'.
#   next: jumps to the next line of the code
#   step: jumps inside a method
#   continue: keeps the program execution until it finds another breakpoint
